# Reprotec UK Ltd - Policies

## Overview

These pages contain the policies that Reprotec UK Ltd employees need to read and understand in order to comply with our obiligations as an employer to provide a safe, fair (and fun) environment to work in!

As we work with a number of clients on sensitive projects it is necessary to make sure that our company and project information is stored and retrieved securely, which is why we are working towards certification in ISO27001.  We also need to make sure that the company operates effectively and effectively, our ISO9001.

## Why are we implementing ISO27001?

For one it’ll make sure we don’t get into any unnecessary trouble and perhaps do something accidental that might implicate a person, our company or a client.

Also, by having these policies we will demonstrate to our clients that we take security seriously and won’t let ourselves or them down. Plus, it will unlock more doors to more clients in the future who count on this level of security from us.

So once you’ve read and understood these policies we’d really like you to accept them which you can do by clicking on the link at the very bottom of this page
